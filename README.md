##Get Started Developing
Our dev environment of choice is Andriod Studio and we are using Unity for Android.

1. Download [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads), [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), [Sourcetree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/), etc.
2. Choose 'clone an existing repository' or equivalent and clone from the url https://github.com/MobileAppsMRHP/spacecolony.git
3. You're set! For now. TODO: Add setup instructions for Unity and the Android Studio options we use.
